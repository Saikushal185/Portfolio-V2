## Overview

This project is a polished personal portfolio focused on data, AI/ML, and engineering work. It includes:

- a landing page with quick search-style navigation
- dedicated pages for about, projects, skills, education, certifications, resume, and contact
- coding profile highlights and competitive programming stats
- an editorial-style blogs section with data analyst and data scientist collections
- route-aware favicons and responsive desktop/mobile navigation
- admin and Supabase-backed functionality for selected flows

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- React Helmet Async
- Lucide React
- Supabase

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the variables used by the app:

```env
VITE_ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=your_n8n_webhook_url
```

Notes:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are required for the admin and Supabase-backed features.
- the app will still start without Supabase keys, but those features will not work correctly

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the local Vite URL shown in your terminal.

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
npm run lint
```
